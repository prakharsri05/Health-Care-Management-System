# Need to work on:
1. Ability to accept the appointment by the doctor to acknowledge the patient that their appointment has been approved.
2. User should not be allowed to register if he/she tries to provide the already registered email ID.
3. The password should be encrypted and the password field shouldn't be displayed in the admin panel.
4. Implementation of pagination for all the list view across the application.
5. Bug fix - Bill payment receipt contains multiple record if the patient has associated with the same doctor multiple times.
6. Addition of more fields in the prescription statement to make it more specific one.
7. Addition of more details on payment - such as date of the payment made, amount paid, etc.
8. Implementation of export button in admin module to export all details to an excel sheet.
